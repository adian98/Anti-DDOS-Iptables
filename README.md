# Anti-DDOS-Iptables
A simple script to help protect your server against bad packets, port scanning and SSH bruteforce. All of the rules in this script are taken from https://javapipe.com/blog/iptables-ddos-protection/
<br />
Note: These rules only help with small attacks or with packets that slipped through your provider's firewall. The script by no means replaces the upstream's DDOS Protection.
